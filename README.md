# Heart Disease Prediction Model

This project focuses on predicting heart disease based on individuals' health profiles using machine learning techniques. It utilizes data preprocessing and predictive modeling to achieve a robust and accurate solution.

## Overview
- **Language & Tools**: R, JupyterLab, tidyverse
- **Objective**: Analyze health variables to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
- **Algorithm**: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: Explored correlations between variables such as age, sex, chest pain type, and cholesterol levels.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Applied scaling, centering, and handled missing values for optimized model training.
- **Model Performance**: Achieved an accuracy rate of approximately **83%**.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/HeartDiseasePredictionModel.git
2. Open the .ipynb file in JupyterLab or any Jupyter-compatible environment.
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to reproduce the analysis and prediction.
